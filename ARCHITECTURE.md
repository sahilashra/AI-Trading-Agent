# AI Trading Agent Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the AI Trading Agent. The architecture is designed for resilience, maintainability, and robustness, incorporating several key design patterns.

## Key Architectural Concepts

- **Centralized State Management (`state.py`):** To avoid circular dependencies and make the application easier to reason about, all shared, mutable state (like the portfolio, caches, and agent running status) is stored in a single `state.py` module. This provides a single source of truth.

- **Custom Error Classification (`errors.py`):** The agent uses a hierarchy of custom exceptions (`TradingError`, `CriticalTradingError`, `MinorTradingError`). This allows the main trading loop to handle different types of errors intelligently, retrying minor issues while shutting down safely on critical failures.

- **Circuit Breaker (`circuit_breaker.py`):** All calls to the external Kite API are wrapped in a Circuit Breaker pattern. If the API starts failing repeatedly, the circuit "opens," and the agent stops trying to make calls for a configured cool-down period. This prevents the agent from spamming a failing service and allows it to recover gracefully.

- **Proactive Health Checks (`health_check.py`):** A comprehensive health check system, triggered by the `/health` Telegram command, allows for real-time diagnostics of the agent. It checks API connectivity, memory usage, cache status, and the state of the circuit breaker, providing a complete operational overview.

- **Asynchronous Operations (`utils.py`):** The `AsyncKiteClient` class acts as an adapter, allowing the asynchronous `asyncio` event loop to communicate safely with the synchronous Kite Connect library via a dedicated worker thread. This prevents blocking calls from freezing the entire application.

- **Graceful Shutdown:** The application is designed to catch system shutdown signals (like `Ctrl+C`). This is handled by the `asyncio` event loop, which raises a `CancelledError` to allow the main trading loop to exit cleanly and perform any necessary cleanup.
