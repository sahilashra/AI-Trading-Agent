# AI Trading Agent Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the AI Trading Agent, a Python-based system designed for automated stock trading. The system now includes an intelligent two-stage screening process and a resilient API key rotation system to ensure continuous operation.

## Key Architectural Changes

### 1. Intelligent Two-Stage Screener
To operate within the free tier limits of the Gemini API, the opportunity discovery process has been redesigned into a funnel:
- **Quantitative Filtering:** The `screener.py` module first scans the entire market index (e.g., NIFTY 100) and filters for all stocks that meet basic, quantitative criteria (e.g., price > 50-day SMA, RSI < 55). This is done locally and is computationally cheap.
- **Ranking & Scoring:** The candidates that pass the initial filter are then scored and ranked based on how well they fit the strategy (e.g., a lower RSI gets a higher score).
- **LLM Analysis:** Only the **top 5** highest-scoring candidates are sent to the Gemini API for the final, qualitative analysis. This drastically reduces API call volume from ~80-100 per cycle to a maximum of 5, ensuring the agent stays within daily free tier limits.

### 2. Resilient API Key Rotation
The agent is no longer dependent on a single API key.
- The `analysis.py` module now contains a `GeminiKeyManager`.
- On startup, it reads a comma-separated list of API keys from the `GEMINI_API_KEYS` variable in the `.env` file.
- If an API call fails with a rate limit error (429), the manager automatically and seamlessly rotates to the next key in the list and retries the request.
- This allows the agent to continue operating even if one or more keys have exhausted their daily free tier quota.
